# Own Homebridge ESP8266 Projects
Smart home is becoming more and more popular and I have started to work on it a few months ago. In this directory I would like to share my ESP8266 and other projects with you, because it is often not easy to find detailed instructions on the Internet. You can find something for everything, but often you have to search a long time until you have all the necessary information together.

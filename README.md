# Homebridge ESP8266 Projects
Smart Home is becoming more and more popular and I have started to work on it a few months ago. In this directory I would like to share my ESP8266 and other projects with you, because it is often not easy to find detailed instructions on the Internet. You can find something for everything, but often you have to search a long time until you have all the necessary information together.

# Projects
Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/jannnfe/homebridge-ESP8266-pojects/wiki) for the Projects!

# Requirements
Every project has its own requirements, which are explained in each article. But what should be in principle for all my projects is:
1. Working version of [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) on a Raspberry Pi or other Linux Server
2. MQTT Broker such as [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)
3. [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/) for easy creation and management of MQTT devices
4. iOS Device with Home App installed and optional an Apple TV 4 as remote station
5. Arduino IDE for flashing (Set up [here](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Arduino-IDE))

How exactly the different components are installed, you can find out on the Internet. There are really beautiful instructions, which are easy to do. Everyone should get there. However, if you experience problems, feel free to contact me [here](https://github.com/jannnfe/homebridge-ESP8266-pojects/issues).

# About me
I am 22 years old and I love to play around with technology. I study media computer science and like to deal with technology. I figured that we live in a time when the computer can make many things easier for us and so I have dealt with the topic of smart home and was caught directly. Forgive me my bad english but i am german and have to translate a lot with a translator. I hope you find something in this directory that interests you. Please share your experience or problems with me [here](https://github.com/jannnfe/homebridge-ESP8266-pojects/issues).
